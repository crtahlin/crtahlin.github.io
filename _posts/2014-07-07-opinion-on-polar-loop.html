I've purchased the <a href="http://www.polar.com/en/products/get_active/fitness_crosstraining/loop" target="_blank">Polar Loop</a>&nbsp;sometime in December 2013, hoping I could do activity tracking with it (24hr heart rate monitoring, step count) and export the data for analysis. I also hoped it would double as a watch. I read an <a href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2013/12/polar-depth-review.html" target="_blank">in depth review</a> of it and decided it was the right device for me. Unfortunately, it came rather short of expectations for several reasons:<br /><br /><ul><li>Data export is still not possible at the time of writing, although it was "unofficially" said it would be available at the end of December 2013. (Without data export the device is quite useless to me.)</li><li>24hr heart rate monitoring (with additional heart rate chest belt) is probably not feasible, since the device seems to use the battery much faster when connected to the chest belt (see the comments in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2013/12/polar-depth-review.html" target="_blank">review</a>).&nbsp;</li><li>24hr heart rate monitoring is probably not feasible, since the device does not have enough memory for the extra data that comes from the chest belt (<a href="http://www.polar.com/e_manuals/Loop/Polar_Loop_user_manual_English/manual.pdf" target="_blank">see tech specs section</a>).</li><li>The device does not record (any?) steps when I hold and push a strawler in front of me, with the hand the device is on. I guess this is to be expected from all wrist worn devices, though.</li></ul><div>Less critical problems:</div><div><ul><li>The display is not visible in bright sunlight.</li><li>To get to the function displaying the time of day, usually several presses of the button are necessary, which is impractical (especially for quickly and discreetly checking the time).</li><li>The device seems to be waterproof. But when washing hands under tap water, the display goes berserk and cycles through all the settings. Not very problematic for me, but some swim with it and it seems to drain the battery even quicker (see the comments in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2013/12/polar-depth-review.html" target="_blank">review</a>).</li><li>The visualizations on the web page are not very easy to interpret in my opinion. The graph of activity is in the form of a circle and details/activities are not easily discernible.
